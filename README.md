# Visual Velocity Theme

**Visual Velocity** is a modified version of Bagisto's default **Velocity** theme, adapted to work seamlessly with [Bagisto Visual](https://github.com/bagistoplus/visual), the visual theme editor for Bagisto.

It preserves the core design and structure of the original Velocity theme while enabling visual customization through an intuitive editor interface.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Visual Editor Compatible**: Fully integrated with Bagisto Visual for no-code customization.
- ⚙️ **Based on Velocity**: Retains the familiar look and layout of Bagisto's default theme.
- 🎨 **Editable Layouts**: Update banners, content blocks, and homepage sections visually.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only the homepage and select theme settings (like fonts and colors) are editable. We plan to expand support to other pages such as category, product, and cart if the project gains interest
